## Bet Sizing in 3-bet Pots

* This video will cover the basics of bet sizing in 3-bet pots
* A primary motivation is avoiding situations with awkward stacks
* It will cover determining how many bets we want to go into the pot
* 

## Web app

* I am currently working on a web app
* The user will enter, stack depth, pot size, and whether he/she is facing a bet, and the algorithm will determine the amount to size a bet (or raise) such that the % of money going in on each street is equivalent (will add a feature to allow user to determine a river bet size, e.g. 100% pot sized shove
* There is a .py files (and soon .java) with the working algorithm
* There is an ipython notebook if you care to see the algorithm used
* This will be my first web app using java so it will take some (hopefully not too much) time
* The original, analytical calculation [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ah-RPYT3zwKodFpLa1JjM0pVbXZPczhoU05XOWVRYlE&usp=drive_web#gid=0)
* iPython notebook for algorithmic calculation [can be found here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/joshplotkin/3BP/blob/master/Higher%20Level/StackPot%20Ratio/app/Bet%20Sizing.ipynb).
